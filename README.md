# Analyzing the episodes of F.R.I.E.N.D.S
In this repository, I did a basic analysis of the popular TV show Friends. I took a look at the sentiment analysis and tried to generate word clouds of each individual characters.

The data used for the project was obtained [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shilpibhattacharyya/Friends_Analysis/master/friends_dataset.csv). The data was quite well organized that it didn't require any cleaning up.
