# Analysing the episodes of F.R.I.E.N.D.S
In this repository, I did a basic analysis from the popular TV show Friends. I took a look at the sentiment analysis and tried to generate word clouds of each individual characters.

The data used for the project was obtained from https://raw.githubusercontent.com/shilpibhattacharyya/Friends_Analysis/master/friends_dataset.csv. The data was quite well organized so it didn't require any cleaning up.

The colaboratory file can be found here. Doing this project gave me an understanding of what data sciece is all about. I hope you enjoy this repo and have fun recreating it. Anything I can do you can do better!
